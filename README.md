# SMC
Scratch Machine Code programming language (BASH version)

This is my new programming language. It's supported both in Scratch (a project will be released soon) and BASH. It should work in every modern Linux distro.

## How to create a program
I'll publish a list of commands soon.

Here's a simple script that will print 1,2,3,4 and 5:
```
10/"i",0
2/5
F/1/"i"/i,1
A/i
E
3
```
Save the program in **program.smc**

## How to run a program

After you saved your program in **program.smc**, navigate to the source code directory and run:
```
./smc.sh
```
